[B]Step 5:[/B] After xml file is created make sure to save file neatly with first letter being CAPS and having the extention .xml. Example: My Sports.xml

[B]Step 6:[/B] To add a thumbnail and fanart for your xml file just simply get your thumbnail image and rename it to your xml filename. For example my xml file is called My Sports.xml so my thumbnail for that file will be My Sports.png or My Sports.jpg. With your fanart you will save it in this format My SportsFanart.png or  My SportsFanart.jpg. Once you are done put those files in the same folder as your xml file which is the My XML Channels folder located in the set xml file path.


Thats all thats needed for now, we will add to it while we improve the section.
Open My XMl Channels in MashUp and you should see your xml file there.

Thanks and Enjoy
